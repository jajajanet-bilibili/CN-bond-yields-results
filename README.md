Negative Impact Analysis of CN Bond Market Volatility
This analysis applies a GARCH(1,1) model to daily yield changes across various maturities of Chinese sovereign bonds (3m, 1y, 5y, 10y) to explore the volatility dynamics and the negative impacts on the market.

Key Findings:
Volatility Persistence:

Alpha (α) and Beta (β) parameters indicate high volatility persistence, especially for the 3m and 1y maturities, where Beta values remain elevated. This suggests long-term volatility following market shocks, making the CN bond market vulnerable to prolonged instability.

Fat-Tailed Behavior (ν or κ):

The t-distribution and GED models show fat tails, indicating a higher likelihood of extreme market events. The tail parameter (ν) for 3m yields was found to be 5.28, indicating significant exposure to extreme volatility shocks. This implies that the market is more sensitive to unexpected events (e.g., geopolitical tensions or economic slowdowns).

Model Fit (AIC, BIC, Log-Likelihood):

The AIC and BIC values suggest that while GED distribution fits the data better for certain maturities, traditional models (like Normal) struggle to account for the volatility extremes. This highlights the limitations of conventional models in capturing real-world market behavior, which is prone to large, unpredictable shocks.

Negative Impact of Shocks:

The CN bond market is highly sensitive to policy changes (e.g., interest rate adjustments, fiscal policy shifts) and external factors like trade wars. The high Beta values and fat-tailed distributions suggest that market reactions to economic slowdowns or unexpected policies can have long-lasting effects.

Conclusion:
The Chinese sovereign bond market exhibits high volatility persistence, fat-tailed risks, and long-lasting effects from market shocks, which makes it highly sensitive to both internal policy shifts and external economic events. Investors should be aware of the increased risk and unpredictability, as traditional models fail to fully capture the volatility dynamics observed in the market.

This analysis underscores the importance of using advanced models like GARCH with GED to better estimate risk and volatility in bond markets, particularly in emerging markets like China.
